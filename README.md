## Hi there 👋
Hello there, I am Fredrik Tokle 👋😊💻

### About me

🔭 I am a Metal worker gone front-end developer

🌱 I decided to seek a new career path 3 years ago. Through sheer will, I managed to combine being a full-time student and a full-time metal worker for 3 years. I recently completed my professional degree in front-end development at Noroff. I am now looking for a job to continue my journey within web development.

😊 Outside of coding, I like to play video games, go jogging, do weight training, and watch Formula 1.
