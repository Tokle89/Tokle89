### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello there, I am Fredrik TOkle ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’»

##About me

ðŸ”­ I am a Metal worker gone front-end developer

ðŸŒ± I decided to seek a new career path 3 years ago. Through sheer will, I managed to combine being a full-time student and a full-time metal worker for 3 years. I recently completed my professional degree in front-end development at Noroff. I am now looking for a job to continue my journey within web development.

ðŸ˜Š Outside coding I like to play video games, jogging and weigth training, and watching formula 1.

Most of my repos are school projects, and it would be awesome if you would open a pull request if you want to play around with it.
